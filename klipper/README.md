### The printer.cfg in has been tested with Ender3 4.2.2 mainboard, with the stm32 and gd32f chipsets. 

### There is no guarantee that it will work for you! You may need to modify the printer.cfg once up and running.
### See the [Mainsail docs](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/) for more info on setting up your printer.
