# Required Tools
- Drill (Drill press preferably)

- Allen wrench set (metric)
- Hacksaw (something to cut the extrusions)

- Metric ruler and calipers (up to 350mm)

## Printing parts:
### Settings:
- ABS or ASA is recommended, but PETG will work (components near the bed and hotend may warp over time if using PETG)
- 0.4mm nozzle
- 0.2mm layer height
- 30% gyroid infill
- 3 perimeters
- 4 top and bottom layers
- Zig Zag support where needed (easier to remove)

- Each component in the STL directory has it's name followed by _x(n), where n is the number of them you need to print. If there is no number, print one.
- Special cases:
    - For the front leg supports, if you are using the stock electronics enclosure, you need to print one left and one right. 
    - If not using the stock enclosure, print 2 lefts
